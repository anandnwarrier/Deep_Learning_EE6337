HW0 was about implementing the main operations of CNN from scratch (using NumPy).
The objective was to implement the following in NumPy:-
1. Convolutional layer
2. Pooling layer
3. A composition of the above two
4. Unravelling layer
5. Fully Connected layer's forward path.

   This assignment deals with only the forward path. In HW1, we have completed the objective of building a CNN using NumPy by adding the backpropogation part. Please look https://github.com/anandnwarrier/Deep_Learning_EE6337/tree/master/HW1
